This repository contains bigwig formatted coverage data for *Drosophila* ATAC-seq "open" regions (<100 bp fragments) comparing wild-type, bicoid, and zelda mutant embryos. Individual embryos were collected 12 minutes after the beginning of NC14 and processed for ATAC seq.
These data are associated with a prior publication: [Hannon, Blythe, & Wieschaus eLife 2017](https://elifesciences.org/articles/28275).
The data are CPM normalized average reads per 10 bp window of replicates merged by genotype, and are mapped to genome version *dm6*. Please see the cited work for additional details of how the samples were generated.
Raw data is available through GEO/SRA at accession number [GSE86966](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE86966).

The "UCSC_display_links..." file is used to display the bigwig files on the UCSC genome browser.
